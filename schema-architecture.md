# Smart Clinic – System Architecture Overview

## Architecture Summary

The Smart Clinic Management System is built using a three-tier architecture, separating concerns across:

- **Presentation Layer** – Handles user interaction through server-rendered views (Thymeleaf) and REST API endpoints.
- **Application Layer** – Contains the backend logic with Spring Boot, including controllers and services.
- **Data Layer** – Manages persistence using two databases: MySQL for structured data and MongoDB for flexible, document-style data.

This structure improves scalability and maintainability. Each layer can evolve independently and supports clean separation of concerns.

## Why We Use Spring Boot and This Stack

Spring Boot simplifies backend development by offering built-in support for:

- Spring MVC for HTML-based dashboards (e.g., Admin and Doctor interfaces)
- REST APIs for decoupled and scalable client-server communication
- Spring Data JPA for working with MySQL (structured data)
- Spring Data MongoDB for flexible data storage (e.g., prescriptions)

Spring Boot is well-suited for modern applications thanks to its developer-friendly features, production readiness, and easy integration with testing, validation, and deployment tools.

## REST APIs and Extensibility

While the dashboards use server-rendered pages, key modules like Appointments and Patient Records use REST APIs. This design:

- Enables integration with mobile apps and other frontends
- Promotes reusability and platform independence
- Supports real-time and cross-platform interactions using lightweight HTTP and JSON

## Deployment and CI/CD

Spring Boot applications can be easily containerized with Docker, making them ideal for deployment on cloud platforms or virtual machines. They start quickly and scale efficiently.

The project is CI/CD-friendly and integrates smoothly with tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI. This allows for automated testing, building, and deployment, helping teams deliver new features and bug fixes quickly and reliably.

## System Architecture: Step-by-Step Flow

1. **User Interface Layer**

   - Users access the app via:
     - Server-rendered HTML dashboards (Thymeleaf)
     - API clients (e.g., mobile apps or frontend apps)

2. **Controller Layer**

   - Handles incoming HTTP requests
   - HTML pages use Thymeleaf controllers that return `.html` views
   - API endpoints use REST controllers that return JSON

3. **Service Layer**

   - Central place for business logic and workflows
   - Handles data processing, validation, and coordination
   - Keeps controllers thin and repositories focused

4. **Repository Layer**

   - Interfaces for accessing databases
   - MySQL: Spring Data JPA for patients, appointments, admins, etc.
   - MongoDB: Spring Data MongoDB for prescriptions

5. **Database Access**

   - MySQL for normalized, structured data
   - MongoDB for flexible, nested documents
   - This combination supports both strict schemas and dynamic formats

6. **Model Binding**

   - Data is mapped into Java objects:
     - JPA entities for MySQL (`@Entity`)
     - MongoDB documents for prescriptions (`@Document`)
   - These models flow through the application logic

7. **Final Output**

   - For HTML dashboards: model objects populate Thymeleaf templates
   - For APIs: model objects (or DTOs) are serialized into JSON responses

---

## Diagram Summary (Verbal)

- Admin and Doctor dashboards use HTML via Thymeleaf
- Modules like Appointments and Patient Records use REST APIs
- MySQL stores core structured data
- MongoDB stores flexible, document-based data

This dual approach balances structure and flexibility while keeping the app scalable and maintainable.

## Conclusion

This architecture ensures a clear flow from user input to data output, enforces separation of concerns, and leverages modern technologies for full-stack efficiency. With this foundation, you can confidently build, debug, and scale the system, and collaborate effectively with others.
